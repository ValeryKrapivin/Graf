Description
This program models a social network as a graph, where the vertices are people and the edges are friendships between them.
The main task is to find pairs of people who do not know each other directly and are at a distance of exactly 2 connections
(that is, they have a mutual friend, but they themselves are not friends).
How the program works
The SocialGraph class implements methods for adding friendships and finding pairs of strangers.
The addFriendship method adds a bidirectional relationship between two people.
The findPairs method finds all pairs of people who are not directly acquainted but have a mutual friend (distance 2).
Usage
In the main() function, a graph object is created.
Friendships are added using the addFriendship method.
The findPairs() method is called, which prints all pairs found.
